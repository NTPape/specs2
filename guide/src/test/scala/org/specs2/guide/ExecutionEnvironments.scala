When you run a specification, a `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` is used to execute examples concurrently.
You can access this `ExecutorService` to execute futures (from Scala, Scalaz etc...), by converting it to the kind of "Execution context" required by your Future implementation.

### Scala Future

A Scala `Future` needs an implicit `ExecutionContext` to be created. You can get an execution context, out of the box, shared across all
specifications by declaring it as a class member: ${snippet{
class MyFutureSpec(using ec: ExecutionContext) extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""
    Let's check this scala future ${Await.result(Future(1), Duration.Inf) must ===(1)}
  """

// in a mutable specification
class MyMutableFutureSpec(using ec: ExecutionContext) extends mutable.Specification:
  "Let's check this scala future" >> {
    Await.result(Future(1), Duration.Inf) must ===(1)
  }
}}

You can also use an `ExecutionEnv` (from now on code examples are provided for immutable specifications only but are transposable to mutable ones): ${snippet{
class MyFutureSpec(using ee: ExecutionEnv) extends Specification:
  def is = s2"""
    Let's check this scala future ${Await.result(Future(1), Duration.Inf) must ===(1)}
  """
}}

This works thanks to an implicit conversion between `ExecutionEnv` and `ExecutionContext` provided by the
`org.specs2.execute.ImplicitExecutionContextFromExecutionEnv` trait
(this can be deactivated by mixing-in the `NoImplicitExecutionContextFromExecutionEnv` trait).

It is actually better to use an `ExecutionEnv` anyway because it is required when you want to ${"create `Future` matchers" ~/ Matchers} (see the "Future" tab).
Indeed an `ExecutionEnv` contains a `timeFactor` which can be used to modify the timeout from the command line and
wait longer for Futures executing on a continuous integration server for example.

### With matchers

Future $Matchers (see the "Future" tab) require an implicit `ExecutionEnv`. This environment is used to access the `timeFactor` when awaiting for Scala Futures.

The `terminate` matcher (see the "Termination" tab in the optional $Matchers section) also needs an `ExecutionEnv` to run a piece of code and periodically
check if it has terminated or not: ${snippet{
s2"""
  this code must be fast enough ${
      given ExecutionEnv = ExecutionEnv.fromGlobalExecutionContext
      Thread.sleep(100) must terminate(retries = 1, sleep = 60.millis)
  }
"""
}}

### One per specification

If you want to have exactly one `Env` or one `ExecutionEnv` per `Specification` you can mix-in the `org.specs2.specicication.core.OwnEnv`
or the `org.specs2.specicication.core.OwnExecutionEnv` traits. You will then get a specific thread pool instantiated and
shutdown just for the execution of one specification. See the ${"environment" ~/ Environment} page for more information.
